<h2>Call for Participation</h2>

<p>You are invited to participate in the IWSPA-AP Shared Task at
IWSPA 2018. The shared task will be on Detection and Analysis of Email nature. 
</p>
<p> The International Workshop on Security and Privacy Analytics (IWSPA) - Anti Phishing Shared Task will feature an exercise in the field of applied machine learning and text analysis in cyber security.
The participants will be asked to build a classifier that will be able to detect phishing emails from spam and legitimate ones in an "unbalanced" dataset.
In order to make the task relatable to a real world situation, the training and testing dataset will have realistic ratios of malicious and legitimate emails (not 50:50).
A sample training data will be provided and the results will be evaluated on a testing dataset that will be posted a week before the results are due.
We ask of the participants to send us their trained model and the results they achieved on the testing dataset.
The participants are encouraged to use any data in their possession, in addition to the one provided, to train their model.
The participants are also free to use any kind of feature engineering, and any type of classifiers. However keep in mind that the dataset is "Unbalanced". </p>
<h3>Tasks</h3>

<p>Detailed Descriptions are coming soon!</p>
 
<p><b>Evaluation</b>: Details are coming soon!</p>

<!--<h3>Registration</h3>-->

<p>Organizations wishing to participate in the CL Shared Task track 
at IWSPA 2018 are invited to register on EasyChair
<p><a href=""></a></p>. Participants are advised to register as soon as
possible in order to receive timely access to evaluation resources,
including development and testing data. Registration for the task 
does not commit you to participation - but is helpful to know for
planning. All participants who submit system runs are welcome to
present their system at the IWSPA 2018.</p>

<!-- <p>Dissemination of CL-SciSumm work and results other than in the
workshop proceedings is welcomed, but the conditions of participation
specifically preclude any advertising claims based on these
results. Any questions about conference participation may be sent 
to the organizers mentioned below.

<p><b><a href="http://capex.cs.uh.edu/?q=content/4th-international-workshop-security-and-privacy-analytics-2018">http://capex.cs.uh.edu/?q=content/4th-international-workshop-security-and-privacy-analytics-2018</a></b></p>

<p>This is the fourth workshop in the series of workshops on
Security and Privacy Analytics. Increasingly, sophisticated
techniques from machine learning, data mining, statistics and
natural language processing are being applied to challenges
in security and privacy fields. However, experts from these
areas have had no medium in the past where they can meet
and exchange ideas so that strong collaborations can
emerge, and cross-fertilization of these areas can occur.
Moreover, current courses and curricula in security do not
sufficiently emphasize background in these areas and
students in security and privacy are not emerging with deep
knowledge of these topics. Hence, we propose to continue
the workshop that we started in the year 2015 to address the
research and development efforts in which analytical
techniques from machine learning, data mining, natural
language processing and statistics are applied to solve
security and privacy challenges (“security and privacy
analytics”). Submissions of papers related to methodology,
design, techniques and new directions for security and
privacy that make significant use of machine learning, data
mining, statistics or natural language processing are
welcome. Furthermore, submissions on educational topics
and systems in the field of security analytics are also highly
encouraged.</p>
